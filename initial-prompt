Could you create a mobile app that will help users prepare for their Norwegian car driving license (FÃ¸rerkort). It should support multiple-choice questions, either using text, or images, both in the question and in the answer options. Start out by supporting 4 options per question. The user should be prompted with 45 questions each time they start a session, and get the score at the end of their session. The questions and answers should be loaded from a JSON API; but for now we can just mock out the data in a .json file. The app should have a landing screen, a list of results from previous tests, a screen to start a new test, and the screens and flows for actually taking a test. Use a modern, engaging, look and feel. 

Use React Native through expo, using the "New Architecture". Follow all best practices, both in development, UX, design and gamification patterns.
