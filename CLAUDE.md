You are tasked with creating a mobile app to help users prepare for their Norwegian car driving license (FÃ¸rerkort). Your goal is to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly application that adheres to best practices in development, UX, design, and gamification patterns. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

Now, follow these steps to develop the application:

1. Technology Stack:
   - Use React Native through Expo, implementing the "New Architecture"
   - Utilize TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience

2. Architecture and Best Practices:
   - Implement a clean architecture with separation of concerns
   - Use Redux for state management
   - Follow SOLID principles and employ design patterns where appropriate
   - Write unit tests for critical components and functions
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and quality

3. App Structure and Screens:
   Create the following screens:
   a. Landing Screen
   b. Results List Screen (previous test results)
   c. New Test Screen
   d. Question Screen
   e. Test Results Screen

4. Data Management:
   - Create a mock JSON file to simulate the API response
   - Implement a service layer to handle data fetching (this will make it easier to switch to a real API later)
   - Store test results locally using AsyncStorage

5. UI/UX Design:
   - Use a modern, engaging look and feel
   - Implement smooth transitions between screens
   - Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the app
   - Ensure the app is accessible and follows mobile UI/UX best practices

6. Gamification:
   - Implement a scoring system
   - Add progress indicators during the test
   - Include encouraging messages based on user performance

7. Implementation Steps:
   a. Set up the project using Expo CLI with the new architecture
   b. Create the app's navigation structure using React Navigation
   c. Implement the main screens and components
   d. Create the mock JSON data file for questions and answers
   e. Implement the quiz logic, including randomization of questions and scoring
   f. Add state management using Redux
   g. Implement local storage for saving test results
   h. Apply styling and animations to enhance user experience
   i. Implement error handling and loading states
   j. Add accessibility features (e.g., VoiceOver support)

8. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Perform manual testing on various devices and screen sizes
   - Conduct usability testing with a small group of users
   - Optimize performance and reduce app size
